# mine-bot

A Discord bot for generating minesweeper boards.

## Installation

Clone this repo.

## Usage

Copy `data/settings/settings.json.template` to a new file and update it with
your token and name.

    $ lein run

## Options

See `data/settings/settings.json.template` for all availablle configuration
options, except for the prefix, which this bot ignores.

## Deployment

    $ sudo docker build .

After tagging and pushing the image, edit deploy.yml with the right image name,
then

    $ kubectl apply -f deploy.yml

Note that the `uberjar` feature of lein is currently non-functional due to the
reliace of the bot framework on configuration files.
